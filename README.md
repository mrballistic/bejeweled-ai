# Bejeweled.ai ðŸŽ®

A modern implementation of the classic Bejeweled game with AI capabilities, built using React and TypeScript.

## Features

- ðŸŽ¯ Classic match-three gameplay with strict move validation
- ðŸŒ“ Automatic dark/light mode based on system preferences
- âœ¨ Smooth GSAP animations with dynamic timing
- ðŸŽ¯ Intuitive drag and drop interface
- ðŸ’¯ Score tracking with combo multiplier system
- ðŸŽ¨ Material-UI components and styling
- ðŸ¤– AI mode (coming soon)

## Game Rules

1. Match three or more identical jewels in a row or column
2. Create matches by swapping adjacent jewels
3. Only valid moves that create matches are allowed
4. Longer matches earn more points
5. Chain reactions (combos) multiply your score

## Scoring System

- 3 matching jewels: 50 points
- 4 matching jewels: 100 points
- 5 matching jewels: 200 points
- Combo multiplier: 1.5x for each consecutive match

## Technologies

- React 18+
- TypeScript
- Material-UI
- GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform)
- React DnD (Drag and Drop)
