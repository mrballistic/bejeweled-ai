# Bejeweled.ai

## Overview
Bejeweled.ai is a web-based match-three puzzle game inspired by Bejeweled 2. It features two modes:
- **Player Mode**: Engage in classic match-three gameplay with drag-and-drop mechanics, score tracking, and level progression.
- **AI Mode**: Watch the AI play the game with visualized strategies and performance metrics.

The game is built using **React** and **Material-UI (MUI)**, with emoji-based game pieces for simplicity and universal compatibility.
