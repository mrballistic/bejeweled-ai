# Bejeweled Clone with AI Mode

## Overview
This project is a web-based match-three puzzle game inspired by Bejeweled 2. It features two modes:
1. **Player Mode**: A classic match-three gameplay experience.
2. **AI Mode**: An automated gameplay mode where an AI demonstrates intelligent decision-making.

The game is built using React and Material-UI (MUI) and uses emoji-based game pieces for simplicity and universal compatibility.

## Features
- **Interactive Game Board**: An 8x8 grid of emoji jewels that players can interact with.
- **Jewel Swapping**: Players can select and swap adjacent jewels.
- **Responsive Design**: The UI is optimized for multiple screen sizes.

## Technologies
- **React**: Frontend framework for building the UI.
- **Material-UI**: Pre-styled components for a polished design.
- **TypeScript**: Ensures type safety and better developer experience.
- **React DnD**: Enables drag-and-drop functionality (planned).
- **Howler.js**: Handles sound effects (planned).
