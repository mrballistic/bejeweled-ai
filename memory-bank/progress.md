# Progress: Bejeweled Clone with AI Mode

## Current Status
The project has reached a significant milestone with a fully playable match-three game featuring modern UI/UX elements and smooth animations. The foundation is solid for adding AI capabilities.

## Completed
1. Core Game Mechanics:
   - Board initialization with no initial matches
   - Jewel selection and swapping
   - Match detection
   - Cascade system
   - Score tracking with combo multiplier

2. User Interface:
   - Material-UI integration
   - Automatic dark/light mode
   - Responsive layout
   - Score display with combo indicator
   - Gradient text effects

3. Animations (GSAP):
   - Dynamic cascade timing based on fall distance
   - Smooth jewel swapping
   - Match disappearing effects
   - Bounce effects for falling jewels

4. Interactions:
   - Click-to-select mechanics
   - Drag and drop support
   - Visual feedback during interactions
   - Adjacent-only move validation

5. Project Structure:
   - React components architecture
   - TypeScript type safety
   - Context providers for state management
   - Custom hooks for game logic
   - Utility functions for core mechanics

6. Documentation:
   - Memory bank system
   - README with setup instructions
   - MIT License
   - Code comments and type definitions

## In Progress
1. Planning AI module architecture
2. Designing special jewel mechanics
3. Sound effect integration planning

## Remaining Tasks
1. AI Implementation:
   - Move evaluation system
   - Path finding algorithms
   - Strategy optimization
   - AI difficulty levels

2. Game Enhancements:
   - Special jewels and power-ups
   - Level progression system
   - Achievement tracking
   - High score system

3. Audio System:
   - Sound effects for interactions
   - Background music
   - Volume controls

4. Additional Features:
   - Tutorial mode
   - Statistics tracking
   - Settings menu
   - Touch device optimization

## Known Issues
None identified at this stage. Previous issues have been resolved:
- Fixed cascade animation timing
- Resolved score display layout shifts
- Corrected initial board match prevention
- Improved animation performance

## Next Milestone Goals
1. Implement basic AI move calculation
2. Add sound effects for core interactions
3. Create special jewel types
4. Design level progression system
