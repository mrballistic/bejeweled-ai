# Active Context: Bejeweled Clone with AI Mode

## Current Work Focus
The primary focus is on implementing the foundational game mechanics and UI for the Bejeweled Clone. This includes:
1. Initializing the game board.
2. Implementing jewel movement mechanics.
3. Detecting matches and handling cascades.

## Recent Changes
1. The technical brief has been reviewed and organized into the memory bank.
2. Core files (`projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`) have been created to document the project's foundation.

## Next Steps
1. Develop the `GameBoard` component to initialize and render the game board.
2. Implement the `Jewel` component for individual game pieces.
3. Create utility functions for match detection and cascade handling.
4. Set up the `ScoreContext` for managing the player's score.

## Active Decisions
1. Use React Context for state management initially, with the option to migrate to Redux if needed for scalability.
2. Prioritize responsive design to ensure compatibility across devices.
3. Focus on efficient algorithms for match detection and cascade handling to optimize performance.
