# Active Context: Bejeweled Clone with AI Mode

## Current Work Focus
The project has evolved into a polished match-three game with robust mechanics. Recent updates include:
1. Strict move validation
2. Enhanced drag and drop functionality
3. Dynamic animation timing
4. Comprehensive documentation updates
5. Cascading and match animations

## Recent Changes
1. Added move validation:
   - Pre-move match checking
   - Invalid move rejection
   - Move simulation before execution
   - Visual feedback for rejected moves

2. Enhanced animations:
   - GSAP integration for smoother transitions
   - Dynamic timing based on fall distance
   - Custom drag preview
   - Bounce effects for cascades
   - Match disappearing effects

3. Improved game mechanics:
   - Consistent validation across click and drag
   - Proper move rejection handling
   - Optimized cascade animations
   - Stable drag and drop behavior

4. Updated documentation:
   - Comprehensive README
   - Updated memory bank
   - Improved code comments
   - Clear project structure

5. Resolved cascading and animation issues:
   - Integrated animations for matches and cascades
   - Ensured smooth transitions and visual feedback

## Next Steps
1. Implement AI module:
   - Move evaluation system
   - Path finding algorithms
   - Strategy optimization
   - Difficulty levels

2. Add sound effects:
   - Match completion
   - Invalid moves
   - Cascades
   - Background music

3. Enhance game features:
   - Special jewels
   - Power-ups
   - Level progression
   - Achievement system

## Active Decisions
1. Use GSAP for all animations to ensure consistency
2. Implement strict move validation for better gameplay
3. Support both click and drag interactions
4. Maintain comprehensive documentation
5. Follow Material-UI design patterns

## Current Issues
None identified at this stage. Previous issues have been resolved:
- Fixed drag and drop behavior
- Improved animation timing
- Added move validation
- Enhanced visual feedback
- Resolved cascading and animation issues
